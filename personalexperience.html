        <h2>My personal experience</h2>
        <p> I do love a good concert. But I often have a couple of concerts, that were outstanding. They were by far
                the best concerts I had.</p>

        <p> Over the years I went to a lot of concerts, in 2022 I started to go to concerts in a more aware manner.
            After that year it all went
            south ways (in a bad way for my bank account, in a good way because I made a lot of new memories and saw
            some amazing artists).
            I have made it my purpose in life to go amazing concerts from my favorite artists. Sometimes when I saw a
            band on Instagram I even got my friend to come with me (to be honest it was not really a succes. the band
            sucked). </p>

        <p><strong>In 2023 I went to 12 concerts</strong>, so that is basically per month a concert (but of course time
            management was
            not like that, because in november a had a drivers exam for my theory and the day before I had a concert in
            Amsterdam) I also went to two concerts all by my self this year and that was an big accomplishment for me.
            In 2024 I had nine concerts to go to, it was less than the year before, but I am very proud of this number
            because of three concerts I went very last minute to.</p>

        <p>I have a feeling that in 2025 I will go to more concerts that are last minute, but that is a sad story,
            because you can not be really excited before hand, but I will be making manifestation playlist so I will
            know the setlist (in time).</p>

        <h3> Throwback time</h3>
        <p>Looking back at some awesome concerts, my all time favorites are for sure:</p>

        <ol class="custom-list">
            <li>Coldplay</li>
            <li>Greta van Fleet</li>
            <li>Molchat Doma</li>
        </ol>

        <p>First of, <strong>I do Like all my concerts,</strong> they have some value. But these are my all time
            Favorites. This is because they had an unique and special way that added in my life. </p>

        <h4> Coldplay </h4>
        <img src="img/coldplay.jpg" alt="The amazing band Coldplay">
        <p>This was my first concert that was in the Johan Cruyff Arena in Amsterdam, it was amazing, the overall vibe,
            the people that were there, the lights that were on our wrist and also the fireworks that could not be seen
            because of the arena. I do not listen to their music often but it is an experience people should not miss
            out on.</p>

        <h4> Greta van FLeet </h4>
        <img src="img/gretavanfleet.jpeg" alt="The band Greta van Fleet">
        <p>So this was my second concert that I attended all by myself. I had scored my sister these tickets, but the
            day of the concert she was very sick. She asked me of I wanted to go, but to be honest, I should have been
            scared to go to a concerts alone and it was in the Ziggo Dome. But a week before I went to my first ever
            solo concert, so I was not that scared. And I went, It was amazing I had the time of my life! I did not know
            of the band before and their music was very different than what I listen to. </p>

        <h4>LEAP </h4>
        <img src="img/leap.jpeg" alt="The band LEAP">
        <p>So, this concert was not really one for the books. To be really honest, they were not so great live. I saw
            them online on Instagram. And after listening more to their music, I was interight to see them live. So I
            texted my best friend and said that we're going to get those concert tickets. So after listening to them
            maybe 15 hours a day for 20 days straight, we finally went to their concert. And they had not the same vibe
            as what they had online. So, maybe we were catfished. Till this day it's still painful to listen to their
            music, because it was that bad. Even the crowd was off. </p>
